# Simulating Stock Market Returns & Crash Risk
An empirical analysis comparing the statistical inferences gained from historical 1928-2019 daily, monthly & quarterly returns data of the S&P 500 Index. The study confirms that using daily stock market returns naively can lead to an underestimation of the risk of extended sell-offs similar to the February-March 2020 episode when the S&P 500 Index tumbled 34% over twenty-three trading days. 

The volatility clustering and aggregational normality phenomena in stock prices cause historical daily returns statistics to underestimate the risk of extended volatility spikes in the S&P 500 Index, and significant drawdowns of 30% or more over a month. Monthly 1928–2019 historical data would have provided higher probabilities of a scenario akin to the February-March 2020 crash, than using historical daily returns data. More recent daily data from the 1990–2019 period would have failed to foresee such an eventuality altogether.
